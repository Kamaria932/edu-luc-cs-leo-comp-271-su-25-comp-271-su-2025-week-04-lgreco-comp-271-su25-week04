## Reflection on Week-03 Assignment 

**What went well:**
My code compiles, it has good logic in the add, index of, contains, and the station counter methods. The search logic looks spot on as well! I avoided traversing the whole list when adding a new station. Added comments that are beginner friendly and in-depth explanations of the logic. 

**Improvements:**
I could have cleaned up the format of my code. Indents where it was needed to make it look neater all throughout my code. I mispelled "Station" one time. I could have avoided commenting on common sense logic. For example i = 0. you know you will start the count at 0 or begin using the number zero, maybe comments stating these are not needed. Duplicate station names. Sometimes to make sure ever. I could have coded it even further to prevent the sation names that have already been added not to appear again, because just like a train it will only stop at that station once until the last one has been called. In my code it will add the stations twice if it was inserted, but this might cause minor issues to a real world train example logic. I could change this by adding if they contain the station name return it. Meaning that if the station is already added stop there and exit early.


**Grade:**
My code compiles and pass the tests in the implementation file, and the logic is similar. I have a lot of things that went well and no comments about things to do differently. My code meets the programmers pact and coding guidelines. I thought of a lot of improvements for my code that shows how to expand my code and make it better, but these are minor changes that can be easily fix and does not affect completing the read me prompts or making the code compile. These are not mistakes but improvements, therefore I would give my work an A.
